abstract: |
  Wildfires are a continuing danger in today's era, having the ability to reduce risk is a 
  significant help in this battle against fire. This work defines the process of research, 
  development and implementation of a fire prevention device. This device implements IoT 
  technologies, such as temperature, humidity and gas sensors, as well as an Arduino as the 
  central core. With the help of a Bluetooth module, the device sends the data to an Android 
  device. This Android device receives the data and analyzes it through a native Android 
  application, thus obtaining the content required by the app. The results obtained from 
  the device correspond to a test stage, so information corresponding to situations of use 
  in real circumstances is not provided.
