# Problem Solution

The solution proposed consists on a device mounted over a Arduino UNO board as the main processing unit, in which wildfire detection systems, such as sound, temperature, humidity and gas sensors will be implemented and connected to the device. The processing unit wil be tasked to access the data provided by each sensor and transmit the information via a Bluetooth sensor to an external database.

In order to power the fire-prevention device, a 9-volt battery will be used. The utilization of a power source of the mentioned type will extend the usefulness of the device, as well as the connected components. The data transmitted by the device during its functioning will be gathered and processed by a computer, showing the information regarding the temperature, humidity and gas of the environment close to the Arduino UNO board, as well as the sound frequencies detected by the sound spectrum sensor.
