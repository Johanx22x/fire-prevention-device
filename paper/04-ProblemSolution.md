# Problem Solution

The solution proposed consists on a device 
mounted over a Arduino UNO board as the 
main processing unit, in which wildfire 
detection systems, such as sound, 
temperature, humidity and gas sensors will 
be implemented and connected to the device. 
The processing unit wil be tasked to access 
the data provided by each sensor and 
transmit the information via a Bluetooth 
sensor to an external database.

In order to power the fire-prevention 
device, a 9-volt battery will be used. The 
utilization of a power source of the 
mentioned type will extend the usefulness 
of the device, as well as the connected 
components. The data transmitted by the 
device during its functioning will be 
gathered and processed by a computer, 
showing the information regarding the 
temperature, humidity and gas of the 
environment close to the Arduino UNO board, 
as well as the sound frequencies detected 
by the sound spectrum sensor.
