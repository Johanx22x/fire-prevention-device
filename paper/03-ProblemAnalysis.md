# Problem Analysis

The current situation of climate change and global warming is 
alarmingly dangerous, and it is growing at an incredible rate. 
The usage of technologies to mitigate the impact of these 
phenomena has increased due to the necessity of a brand-new 
solution. 

As stated previously in this document, wildfires in forestal 
zones have been tremendous hazards increased in amount and 
potency by climate change. In order to dimish the effect that 
this natural disaster has in de areas of interest, various 
technological resources are being applied to discover patterns 
and predict formations of forest fires before they even 
consolidate. 

To achieve the objecive of reducing the inflections of this 
natural phenomena, it is necessary to acknowledge the risks 
and dangers of wildfires, as well as to get to know more about 
its properties and the ways that they can be distinguished and 
prevented. This will contribute to better detection systems, 
which can alert faster the required authorities or devices to 
put the fires out or control the temperature and status of the 
affected area.
