# Future Works

The prototype device designated for this proyect could be applied succesfully in a uncontrolled environment such as a forest, if some aspects are enhanced. Nontheless, the base of idea can develop to function precisely and effectively on the field.

Some of the characteristics that could be improved are the communication method between the application and the Arduino UNO board. Communication technology such as LoRa or others is recommended, since the connection via Bluetooth can suffer interference when located in an place with no controlled variables, which can deteriorate the functionality of the device. 

Adding to the previous premise, it would be a great improvement to add and implement a thermal camera, as well as a sound-spectrum-based sensor. Both IoT components could add to the rapid detection of wildfires, as well as providing a better image to the situation of interest. In the sound sensor's case, the implementation of this device could be an uncommon solution to the problematic, while also been efective if used precisely.
