# State of Art

Throughout the years, there have been a large number of 
investigations dedicated to the detection and eradication of 
forest fires in early stages, but nevertheless, those that 
seek to solve the problem by implementing the most efficient 
technologies providing greater security are at the forefront. 
This section provides a state of the art corresponding to 
those innovative solutions that seek to reduce forest fires, 
utilizing diverse technological resources to manage the 
acomplishment of the goal of interest.

The article "Forest Fire Prevention Using WSN Assisted IOT" 
was published in 2018 by [@vimal2018forest], 
in which they give a detailed explanation of the creation of a 
wireless-sensors-based network that has the capacity to 
collect data and comunicate with an external layer of 
unmanned aerial vehicles. These vehicles are tasked with the 
objecive of reducing the temperature in the affected area. The 
article also explains several protocol subjects, such as 
connectivity issues and diverse technical concepts about the 
functioning of the network.

The base premise of the methodology implemented indicates that 
a layer of nodes, capable of collecting information about 
their local environment, are grouped in small batches called 
"clusters". These clusters provide an excelent solution to a 
frequent problem shown in these technologies, which is the 
energy consumption rate. Because each node in a cluster works 
to excecute a single function, the energy provided, which is 
given by a battery, is distributed throughout the group of 
nodes, diminishing the amount of charges each cluster 
requires. Using the advantages of clustering technologies, 
several clusters can comunicate (via a specific node tasked to 
connect with the rest of the network) along themselves to 
alert if there is a sudden change in the space each one 
controls. This warning sends signals to the previousely 
mentioned "unmanned aerial vehicles", for them to apply the 
necessary measures to reduce the area temperature.

The article of interest goes along to explain as well the 
implementation of other concepts, such as algorithms for 
clusters, neural networks and classifiers, such as decision 
trees and Naive Bayes classifier. All of these applications 
promote the capability of each cluster to "sense" the events 
happening around them and predict future wildfire phenomena. 
By increasing the aptitudes of the cluster tecnology used, a 
better management of forest fires is attained efficiently, 
proving the results of the experiment to grant a satisfactory 
response.

A second article, published in 2022 by [@grari2022early], 
explains how to detect forest fires during the period in which 
they start to form, implementing linear-regression mechanisms, 
computer vision and various other machine-learining 
technological components. The paper "Early wildfire detection 
using machine learning model deployed in the fog/edge layers 
of IoT" develops a system that collects data provided by the 
NASA utilizing the "fire information for resource management 
systems" database (FIRMS). Using machine learning, it is 
posible to achieve analitical resources that calculate the 
intensity of the radiation that the wildfire emits, 
transalted as megawatts. An important point to highlight is 
that the analysis obtained by this system equal a total of 99% 
in the R2 metric, demonstrating the efficiency of the 
implementation of machine learning and Fog and Edge computing 
in a rapid detection and alert of forest fires.

The authors explain that the use of machine learning concepts to 
provide estimates and promote fire prevention techniques is 
explained in a detailed manner. Using the NASA dataset, FIRMS, 
diverse algorithms and calculations are implemented in the 
system, as well as data from many other datasets with 
information about past fires, in order to predict new forest 
fires and their prevention. The proposed solution composes a 
relevant tool to benefit the environment and reduce detection 
times between the creation of the wildfire and its treatement. 
It is important to stand out the fact that the utilization of 
Fog and Edge computing for a faster data processing is an 
essential point to take in account when working with a massive 
node network, such as a series of interconnected devices laid 
out in a forest.

Besides the conventional methods used to identify fires, sound 
spectrums have been the most innovative of them recently. 
[@zhang2019wildfire] published an article titled "Wildfire 
Detection Using Sound Spectrum Analysis Based on the Internet 
of Things", in which an innovative solution to a fast detection 
of wildfires is provided, using the different sound frequencies 
that are unique to fire, to achieve a prevention technique 
that doesn't require a great bandwidth. Besides that, a new 
power source called "tree-energy device" is applied to the 
system, that consists on a method to provide the necessary 
energy to the various IoT devices using the trees' biological 
energy to produce electric energy.

There is a great emphasis on the many ways that currently exist to 
dettect and prevent wildfires, such as "ground patrol", 
"remote video monitoring", "artificial tower observation", 
among others, to demonstrate the innovative factor that this 
new solution based on sound spectrums has. The article explains 
thoroughly the process of obtaining the environmental sounds 
and analysing the information in the lookout of the correct 
frequencies that a wildfire emits. On the other hand, it also 
states that a frecuent dilema found in the creation of this 
technology were the sound alterations in a uncontrolled 
environment, such as a forest.

In 2018, [@saeed2018iot] published an article titled "IoT 
Based Intelligent Modeling of Smart Home Environment for Fire 
Prevention and Safety", in which the authors state their 
objective as to create a WSN (wireless sensors network) with a 
better structure than usual and with a smaller margin of 
error. The article functions as an example of the 
implementation of IoT in a controlled space, such as a home, 
to detect fires. This contrasts with an environment such as a 
forest, but is useful to test the capabilities of clustering 
technologies and the ZigBee protocol in the detection and 
prevention of spontaneous combustion.

Neural networks are a useful tool to implement in fire detecction sistems, 
as a fifth article titled "IoT Sensor and Deep Neural Network 
Based Wildfire Prediction System" and published in the month 
of May of 2020 by [@zope2020iot] demonstrates. In the article, the authors 
explain the monitoring process that they excecuted to control 
a forest environment in order to collect data, such as 
humidity, temperature, and more. This information was used to 
generate calculations that would provide an estimate about new 
formations of wildfires, via a neural network of deep learning 
and various IoT devices, laid out in a wide area.

The authors proceed to show how are the IoT sensors utilized 
in order to gather real-time data, which are then processed in 
a CSV document for them to be stored. They demonstrate in 
detail the conection of each device with the sensors and the 
external database. There is also an emphasis on the deep learning of 
each device, using previous registered wildfires' information 
to predict and prevent this type of phenomena. 

The authors [@kaur2020cloud] state that the implementation of 
Fog and Cloud computing to create a wildfire 
prevention system could predict forestal events based on 
real-time data processed by artificial neural networks. In an article 
published in 2020, titled "Cloud-assisted green IoT-enabled comprehensive 
framework for wildfire monitoring", it is demonstrater how the Fog 
layer can be used to analize data in the spot, not requiring 
the influence of the Cloud to generate responses as fast as 
posible.

Various datasets were used as base resources for estimates of 
forest fires, helping the artificial neural network in 
providing estimates about new formations of wildfires. It 
makes the usage of Fog computing at its limit stand out, using 
IoT nodes that obtain on-time data to transmit the information 
to the Fog layer for it to generate data visuals and more 
statistic tools. It is necessary to highlight that there is a 
certain waiting time between the processing of data and the 
transmission of information to the database.

In order to treat a wildfire in a correct manner, it is necessary 
to analize the risks and dangers of the fires. A review article 
made by [@thompson2011uncertainty], titled "Uncertainty and 
risk in wildland fire management: A review" 
and published in 2011, provides the knowledge required to 
asume wildfires' risks and dangers, as well as how to treat 
them or control them. The article remarks the inflections of 
forest fires in the environment, highlighting the effect over 
animal populations and global warming, one of the subjects 
that has caused more new formations of the phenomena of 
interest.

Besides temperature, sound and humidity, 
[@morocho2021implementacion] demonstrate that gas in the 
environment is also a resource that can be used in wildfire 
detection. In their paper, "Implementation of a 
Geographical-Positioning Monitoring System for Forest Fires 
Prevention Using a Sensory Network" published in 2021, the 
authors establish a node-based sensory network with LoRa 
communication, utilizing ThingSpeak to alert in case of a 
wildfire formation. For the detection process, the article 
indicates the monitoring of parameters such as carbon dioxide 
and wind velocity in the near environment.

The authors apply a sensory network consisting of three 
strategically distributed nodes, which gather the required 
data from gases located in the area and send the information 
to a main router. This router then emits the data to the 
ThingSpeak Internet Platform, in which all information is 
processed. The article highlights the usage of LoRa technology 
to communicate between nodes and with the main router.

As it is seen in "Learning to coexist with wildfire", 
published in 2014 by [@moritz2014learning], it is necessary to remark the problematics that are 
caused yearly by wildfires, as well as the risk and dangers 
that treating them can lead to. It is necessary to higlight the situation of 
countries such as Australia and USA, in which forest fires are 
more common than they should be, demonstrating the impact that 
the recently abrupt climate change has dealt in the world.

Finally, a tenth article, published in 2017 by 
[@vinueza2017implementacion] and titled "Implementation of a 
small wireless sensors network for early detection of forest 
fires using open source hardware and software", explains how 
the authors implemented a WSN using open source resources to 
obtain data such as temperature, humidity, smoke, among 
others, and transmit the information to a reciever device to 
process and store the data. This information would be later 
transformed and analized into variables and images such as 
graphs and tables in a web application.

A wireless-sensor-based mini-network is described to be
divided in three subsystems: the transmitter, the receptor and 
the storage subsystem. It provides an interesting and useful 
view of an architecture capable of analyzing important data 
regarding fire detection in an uncontrolled environment, such 
as a forest.
