# Introduction

In the current century there is a large presence of forest fires throughout the planet, 
this due to modern problems such as global warming, deterioration of the ozone layer 
among others. This is why there is a high risk of unexpected and fast-spreading wildfires. 
Providing high-speed responses to these wildfires is a difficult task, so thinking about a 
better way to detect a wildfire as soon as possible is a potential solution to reduce the 
number of wildfires around the world.

The objective of this paper is to provide one of these solutions, it seeks to implement 
a device for the detection of forest fires in early stages. To achieve this objective, an 
investigation of the current state of the technologies available for fire detection is 
carried out, seeking to implement systems with autonomous operation.

Throughout the article the development process of a fire prevention device is detailed. 
Implementing an Arduino as the core and with the incorporation of temperature, gas and 
humidity sensors, in addition, a Bluetooth module is used for data transmission between 
the device and an android application designed to visualize the data obtained.
