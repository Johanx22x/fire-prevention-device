# Conclusion

The implementation of IoT in devices designed for detection and prevention of 
wildfires in forestal areas has proved to have an excelente rate of usefulness, 
as stated in many related works mentioned in this document. Regarding the proposed 
solution for this problematic, the use of IoT grouped with various recognition 
sensors and an Arduino UNO board has demonstrated an effective conection between
the detection processing unit and the user interface, achieving the main goal of 
the IoT concept and allowing the conclusion of an efficient response from the sensors 
towards the application.

It is also possible to conclude that wildfire preventions systems all around the world 
are constantly proposing innovative solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change 
and global warming. This iniciative has improved along the years, and will continue to 
do so in the upcoming decades, due to the agravating consecuences the environmental issue 
of interes has had in many places of the world.
