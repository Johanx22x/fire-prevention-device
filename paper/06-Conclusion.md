# Conclusion

The prototype device provided statisfactory results regarding the gathering 
of data from the humidity, temperature and gas sensors. The data was transmitted 
from these components to the Arduino UNO board effectively, proven by the test 
made when connected by cable to a computer. It is safe to conclude that the IoT 
components are a simple yet efficient way to gather certain parameters of data, 
reducing the power source needed to mantain the devices functioning.

Another conclusion to be made is that, by gathering succesfully the data 
provided by the sensors and the main processing unit, it is posible to 
facilitate the monitoring processes over the required data points. In a case 
where these have to be monitored manually, the implementation of a device 
like this can ease the gathering and understanding of the parameters.
